                            <p> I have a Galaxy S9+ and I want to make the most out of my battery to save some. My phone has been dying a lot lately and I do my best to stay out of the apps that consume the most battery. My Question is, is do Greenify or Hibernation Manager work as what they are claimed to do? Links for the Apps are here on Google Play: Greenify: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.greenify Hibernation Manager: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.root.battery.saver.sle. Back in the day, I used to just hibernate apps with Titanium Backup, but then I heard about Greenify, but never used it myself. My phone doesn't have a lot of bloatware, but I kind of want to completely shut off some of them, and especially Gapps. Does Greenify works well to do that today? If not, what's another option? I'm running stock Oreo on a rooted phone. Consider that I don't plan to use a custom ROM (yet), that's why I'm asking. Thank. I don't use it to hibernate apps. I am talking about this (https://i.imgur.com/OrPYzwQ.png). 'Agressive Doze' and 'Doze on the Go'. (My phone is not rooted). I have a custom rom at android 9 and i was wondering if greenify would be helping. I'm looking for an app(Non root) that stop heavy apps like fb,snapchat,insta in the background as it always clogs up my ram. Tried Greenify,Amplify but the process is really confusing. 
Basically what the title says. I decided to buy the premium version of Greenify after I noticed that some system apps like QuickMemo were eating around 8% of my battery. The results were a little odd, as the battery life hasn't improved a lot, but the overheating is almost gone (sometimes the phone would get unbearably hot while doing something trivial, like browsing the web). I hope this might help some of you suffering from the same issue. Title, They usually make the game slot faster and are they OK to use? I've been using Greenify. Is Greenify still useful on like on android pie? I mean, isn't the restrict background activity option in android strong enough. Which do you use and why? Big difference. hey everyone. for those that have used it, what are your thoughts? Does it conflict with anything? Is it all of skyrim. I created a Greenify hibernation task because auto hibernation started the moment my screen went off, and I couldn't find a way to delay the hibernation. So I created a task to hibernate, wait 1min, and when the screen is off. Unfortunately the task never triggered when it was supposed to. Sometimes it would hibernate when my screen was on while I'm in the middle of something, but that was happening even after I removed the task, so maybe something is off with Greenify. I uninstalled/reinstalle. A while back I remember reading that apps like Greenify did not do much, and in some cases, made things worse (battery life-wise). I think this may have been around the time that Android natively started to put apps to sleep (or Samsung's version). Is this still the case? My reddit app, Joey, has been using a significant amount of battery over the past month or so. Even the dev for Joey is stumped, and said I was the first one to bring it to his attention. He recommended Greenify, so I thoug. I just rooted my Samsung Galaxy S7. I removed most of the bloatware, got MagiskManager and MagiskHide set up and installed some Mods. Are there some usefull tips you can give me ? What are some Mods u can recommend? Should i flash a custom ROM? What should i do now? Thanks 
https://wtffix.com/how-to/manage-startup-programs/greenify-app/ (https://wtffix.com/how-to/manage-startup-programs/greenify-app/). Do you guys still greenify Snapchat? I'm wondering if I should stop but I don't know if it improved on battery. Is there anyway someone can help me without having me test my battery for weeks? I have limited time that I can return it if I need to and get a new one with an adequate battery and am kind of worried. I'd say the phone would last about 4 and half hours of full screen time from 100% to being dead. I'm not sure how normal that is, I can post pictures of whatever is needed but could really use some guidance here from someone. Thanks to anyone who can steer me in the right direction or help. 
Does greenify without root any useful now? Will it stop apps from running in the background https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/how-to-clear-the-ram-on-my-mobile-device/. So I have a Galaxy Note 9 and got it the day it came out. My battery used to last around 16-18 hours before I had to worry about charging it. But now it's half dead around noon time. And I take it off the charger around 7:30. What can I do to get back that life? Because now I have to charge my phone a couple times through 
something like Greenify or DU Speed Booster is it good? </p>
