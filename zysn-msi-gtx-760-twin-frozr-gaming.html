                            <p> Upgrading my system so I no longer need my 760. It's in perfect working condition, runs most games on almost max settings @60fps. Twin Frozer Gaming edition with the two fans on the backplate, very pretty to look at and you can overclock it easily using MSI's apps. Looking for around £90. http://www.imgur.com/gallery/4M1bGFa/. Since I don't have space for a PC in my tiny apartment, I am selling my old gaming PC. Price is negotiable.

Hi all I am a gamer that doesn't get much time to game (around 6 hours a week) but still have my Steam account with over 500 games and an average computer that does a reasonable job. My current specs are: Intel Pentium G3258 (Haswell) 20th Anniversary Edition CPU MSI B85-G43 GAMING motherboard Kingston HyperX FURY 16GB Kit (2x8GB) 1866MHz DDR3 CL10 DIMM MSI GTX 760 TwinFrozr Gaming 2 GB video card A friend is selling his old computer which is in really good order and has the followi. Sup guys! Up for sale I have a 2013? MSI GTX 760 Twin Frozr Gaming series, OC Edition. It was installed in a computer I had originally planned to use for gaming, but largely forgot about and never touched. This card is in damn near perfect condition, with all original peripherals, manuals, and driver discs it came with, plus the box, which is also in great condition if that's something you care about. While this isn't your top of the line GTX1080, this is a very good budget card. Before 
Case: Corsair 760T Black Motherboard: MSI Z87 Gaming GD65 GPU: MSI GTX 760 TwinFrozr Gaming 2 GB CPU: Intel i5 4670K RAM: 8GB G.Skill Ripjaws Z Radiator: Swiftech 360MM Fittings: Primochill 1/2in Revolver Reservoir: Torpedo Tube Pump: Swiftech MCP655-B D5 Coolant: Mayhems Aurora 2 Red I made this build from spare parts to eventually sell. Dissapointed in the way the Mayhems Aurora came out maybe it was too old or didn't use enough. Can anyone give me a ballpark price I should be selli. I recently completed my pc build and am very happy with it but i do not have a gpu due to me waiting for 1080 aib's. I had a 1080 ftw on pre-order but canceled so i can wait for more types of releases or for the 1080ti which prob is 2017 im assuming(after many many friends telling me to wait). So my options are buy 760 tomorrow of cl for 0 MSI GTX 760 Twin Frozr Gaming, Or wait for amd's 0 card to hold out for a long time or keep browsing cl , hardwareswap , buildapcsales 24/7 haha.

Selling my MSI TWIN FROZR GTX 760 2GB GAMING OC EDITION for  shipped. Never overclocked only used to play COD titles sparingly. Very quiet card. http://m.imgur.com/a/lVeOh. So I'm building a new gaming PC, ideally something that can run recent titles and upcoming ones (lets say for example Dragon Age Inquisition or The Witcher 3, assuming they end up being any good) on high settings. The graphics card I already have is only about two years old (it's a HIS H785F2G2M Radeon HD 7850 2GB 256-Bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 x16 HDCP) and a 650W power supply, so I'm really looking more for an increase in RAM and processing power. Here's a rough build of what I was thinking. GPUs: EVGA FTW 3 ~~x4~~ x2 - 0 ~~Asus Strix OC 0~~ Aorus Extreme x2 0 ~~MSI Twin Frozr VI Gaming X 0~~ EVGA SC2 0 ~~Gigabyte GTX 760~~ – If anyone has a good story for why they need it, you’re introducing your little sibling to the glorious addiction of PC gaming or something like that, post it in the comments and as long as you pay shipping, I’ll hook someone up. Mobo/CPU/RAM: MSI Z270 SLI, G4650, Alpine II GT cooler, Crucial Ballistics 8GB 2400MHz amp#x200B; i built the following 7 years ago. I upgraded to a 1070Ti a year or two ago. It seems that the case, power supply, the upgraded video card and are fine to re-use. So, i'd like some recommendations of a CPU, Motherboard, Memory, SSD to fully refresh my build. I have a 3TB HDD as well for mass storage. My monitor is a fairly nice 24 inch 1080p monitor. I think i'd be looking to spend about 0 to 0 roughly. I am not sure why the editing is so bad, sorry. Forgot 
Noticed my gpu getting toasty while gaming (86 celsius), so i opened the pc and it was full of dust. Decided to open the gpu up, as it was'n the first time changing the paste on a gpu (just not this card) Everything goes smoothly and i noticed there is an ''integrated support bracket'' inside gpu and the memory chips make contact with the metal thing. So i checked to see if the thermal pads are ok anddddd they weren't. Ended up destroying the pads by opening the card up. amp#x200B;. Hey /r/buildapc ! Long time lurker, first time poster. I am, at best, a very casual observer of pc hardware news and builds. I built my rig back in 2014 when I got some money back from taxes and I've loved being part of the PCMR ever since. A bit over 5 years later, though, it's time to upgrade what was back then a mid-range pc, that's now struggling heavily with keeping up. Since my knowledge is both rusty and a bit limited, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the upgrades I've looked Hi, all. I'm parting out two of my old builds to prep for my 2019 build. I OC'ed the RAM for maybe a year, but only up like 300 mhz. I have a 13-14% OC on my Z170 mobo. Usage includes recreational gaming for 1-2 hours daily. All prices are + shipping. Definitely not super comfortable with market rates for these items, so call me out on bad deals if need-be. Local is 23224, happy to drive up to NOVA for my fellow VA'ers.

All benchmarks seem to be in favour or the latter, so I wanted to have your thoughts on this upgrade. Is it worth the price difference? It definitely seems to be. But most importantly, will it play nice with the rest of my components or will it be somehow limited in the current configuration?

(::partyemoji::) But, it requires my wife and I to relocate to the Pacific Northwest by the end of this month. As much as I'd love to take all of my hardware up with me, I'm sure some of you guys would benefit from something here. Plus, I'd like to do something nice for my wife and take her on a mini-vacation before I start my job. Because if it wasn't for her I wouldn't have gotten the courage to apply to a company that I thought was out of my league. </p>
