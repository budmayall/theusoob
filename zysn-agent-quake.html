                            <p> Good day to you all, fellow Future Fight-ers. I come before you today to humbly make a case for the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, Daredevil. As you all may know, Netmarble will open voting for character reworks soon, and among the characters available for voting is Matt Murdock himself. Now don't get me wrong, I do believe that every character on the list deserves a rework (bar Rogue, as she is actually somewhat decent? She's not the best character, but is far above the other nine characters avail. During the last invasion on Avengers Academy, Daniel Whitehall and the Hydra School took the opportunity and attacked the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy. With S.H.I.E.L.D. technology in their arsenal and former students of the other school locked up, they set their sights on Avengers Academy. Each week you fight Hydra grunts on the world map and then fight a boss. New Recruits: Victoria Hand, Leopold Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Lance Hunter, Alphonso "Mack" Mackenzie, Grant Ward, Melinda May, Jeffery 
I really want to start a campaign similar in vein to the #savedaredevil movement to crossover the show and the movies. It seems the two seem to be growing further and further apart, but we at least want acknowledgment from the movie side, either by collaborating with story threads (either movie to TV, or even TV to movie, so they can write tie-ins) or actual crossovers (either way). I’d really like to get support to launch this campaign, as Marvel listens to their fans. I believe I don’t remember reading this, because it was a long time ago, but it just popped into my mind today and I wanted to discuss it with all of you. I read once, that the main reason Quake hasn’t been in an Avengers Movie is because most fans (of the movies) don’t know who she is. I don’t buy it. Because if that’s the reason then why doesn’t Quake have her own movie yet? They did it with Captain Marvel, Iron Man, Hulk, and Thor. But that’s okay, because I’d rather she pair up with the Guardians. I think for me it is maybe Daisy with a slight edge. So Daisy 60% versus Coulson 40%. Though Fitz has been getting more in the spotlight even though he aint on main character level yet. Certainly up there though. What do you guys think? You can say it on the show as a whole or maybe devide it up by different seasons. gt!When the sorcerers portal in every one, Strange asks: "Is that everyone?"!lt gt!Wong replies "You want more?" Which is actually different from "of course" or "this IS everyone" or "there's no one else!"!lt The final act really shows us that the movie is already crowded Both Spidey and Daisy have two uniforms. Which one is the best for that character? All New or Black suit? And Quake vs Agents Quake. 
New to home (condo) owner life and really do not have much guidance. Was hoping to get input on what is recommended coverage for my unit. Also currently do not have earthquake insurance, should I? Closest big fault is the hayward fault, but from what I understand i am decently far away from it. amp#x200B; Reside in Dublin California Condo was purchased for 8,000 Annual insurance premium is 9.00 Deductible 0 Building property limit is ,200, personal property ,100 The remnants of SHIELD vs Thanos’ mini-Boss squad. This is the best tl;dr I could make, original (https://www.france24.com/en/20190531-rise-machines-ai-beats-humans-multiplayer-shooter) reduced by 66%. (I'm a bot) gt A team of programmers at a British artificial intelligence company has designed automated ampquot;Agentsampquot; that taught themselves how to play the seminal first-person shooter Quake III Arena, and became so good they consistently beat human beings. gt More recently, a Google AI agent beat the worldamp#039;s. </p>
